### Structure of the application
This Application is divided into components, assets and styles.

1. components: This contains all the modular components of this application.
2. styles: This folder contains style sheets for the respective components. Please note, I have used SASS, which is really popular CSS pre-processor.
3. assets: contains all the images, logos and banners required in the application.

### index.js and Layout.js

These two files are outside the folder structure.
1) index.js : This is the default entry point for any ReactJS application.
2) Layout.js : This a class based component which renders all the other defined components and arranges them in systematic order. This contains only other components and has no logic on its own.
